        <h4>A company is currently having their annual employee review of exercise, they've
            successfully evaluated the performance of each employee, and they want to use as a
            metric to determine the percentage increase in salary. They are taking the following I to
            consideration;
            a. Employees age.
            b. Number of years an employee has spent at the company.
            c. Performance score (1 - 10)
        </h4>
    </div>
    <p>
    <ul>

        <li> Employees above 30 years automatically have a $100 increase, employees over
            50years automatically have a $200 increase. While the percentage increase in salary
            salary is calculated using the formula ( ( No of years / 10) * performance score).
            So if a 40yr old employee current salary is $1000, and has spent 20years in the
            company with a performance score of 5. His new salary would be calculated as follows;
            %raise = (20 / 10) * 5
            %raise = 10%
            10% of $1000 = $100
            Age bonus = $100
            New salary => $1000 + $100 + $100 = $1,200.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Given an Object literal of people's name as key, and salary details (Object) as value,
        Calculate the following;
        a. New salary of all employees
        b. A list of employees that got over 15% overall raise.
        c. Overall payout increase by the company.
