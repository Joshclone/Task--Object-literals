<h2>Javascript Object Constructors
</h2>
<p id="de">

</p>
<hr>
<p>
    In JavaScript, Object can be created in primarily 2 ways. <br>

    a. Using Object Literals <br>
    b.Using Objects Constructors <br>
    In not
    more than 7 lines, explain the difference between Object Literals and Object constructors like you would to a 5
    year old.
</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Object created using object Literals are <b>Singletons</b>, this means when a change is made to the object,
            it affects the object entire script.</li>
        <li>
            Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't
            affect the object throughout the script.
        </li>
        <li>
            <script>
                var student = {
                    name: "Ravi"
                }
                var newStudent = student;
                document.write("Before change");
                document.write("</br>");
                document.write("student name = " + student.name);
                document.write("</br>");
                document.write("new student name = " + newStudent.name);
                document.write("</br>");
                newStudent.name = "Joshua";
                document.write("<b>After change</b>");
                document.write("</br>");
                document.write("student name = " + student.name);
                document.write("</br>");
                document.write("new student name = " + newStudent.name);
            </script>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Object defined with a function constructor lets you have multiple instances of that object. This means
                change made to one instance, will not affect other instances
            </li>
            <li>It essentially boils down to if we need multiple instances of our object or not; object defined with a
                constructor let us have multiple instances of that object. Object literals are basically singletons with
                variables that are public </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<script>
    function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
        this.firstName = first;
        this.lastName = last;
        this.age = age;
        this.eyeColor = eye;

    }
    var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");

    var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

    document.getElementById("de").innerHTML = "My father is " + myFather.age + " . My mother is " + myMother.age + ".";
